# Next.js Project with TypeScript, Data Fetching, Error Handling, and CSS Modules

This is a **Next.js** project that demonstrates key features such as **TypeScript integration**, **data fetching**, **error handling**, **dynamic routing**, and **CSS Modules**. The project fetches posts from the [JSON Placeholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) and displays them in a clean, responsive UI. It also includes dynamic routing for individual posts and a custom error page for handling errors gracefully.

This project is part of a tutorial video on the [**OnePiece Coding**](https://www.youtube.com/@OnePieceCoding) YouTube channel.
